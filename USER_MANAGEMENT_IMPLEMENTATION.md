   - Enhanced with user portal requirements

2. **payments** (new)
   - Complete payment tracking system
   - SumUp integration support
   - Payment status and history

3. **payment_requests** (new)
   - Admin-initiated payment requests
   - Email integration for payment notifications
   - Status tracking and reminders

4. **user_sessions** (new)
   - User login/logout tracking
