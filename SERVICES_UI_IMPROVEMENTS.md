# Services Management UI Improvements

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Missing Labels in Edit Mode

### Problem
When editing services in the Services Management interface, there were no labels to identify what each input field was for, making it confusing to know what was being edited.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Edit Service Form - Enhanced Labels** 
Added clear, descriptive labels for all fields:

- **Service Name*** - with required indicator
- **Category** - with dropdown selection
- **In-Hour Price** - with helper text "Regular business hours rate"
- **Out-of-Hour Price** - with helper text "After hours/weekend rate"  
- **Fixed Price (if not hourly)** - with helper text "Use this OR hourly prices, not both"
- **Service Description** - for detailed service information

#### 2. **Visual Improvements**
- **Section Header**: Added "Edit Service" heading to clearly indicate edit mode
- **Helper Text**: Added small gray helper text under key fields to explain usage
- **Better Placeholders**: More descriptive placeholder text with examples
- **Field Grouping**: Proper spacing and organization of related fields

#### 3. **Add New Service Form - Enhanced**
Also improved the "Add New Service" form with similar helper text:

- **Flat Price**: Added "Use this OR hourly prices, not both" guidance
- **Hourly Pricing**: Added explanatory helper text for business vs after-hours rates
- **Consistent Labeling**: Matched the edit form styling and information hierarchy

### User Experience Improvements

#### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Clear labels for every field
- ✅ Helper text explaining pricing options
- ✅ Visual hierarchy with section headers
- ✅ Guidance on when to use flat vs hourly pricing
- ✅ Consistent labeling between add and edit modes
- ✅ Professional, user-friendly interface

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified:
- `src/components/admin/Services.tsx` - Enhanced edit form UI

#### Key Changes:
```tsx
// Before: Just input fields with placeholders
<input placeholder="Name" />
<input placeholder="In Hour Price" />

// After: Proper labels with helper text
<div>
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1">
    Service Name *
  </label>
  <input placeholder="Enter service name" />
</div>

<div>
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1">
    In-Hour Price
    <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 block">Regular business hours rate</span>
  </label>
  <input placeholder="e.g., €65" />
</div>
```
