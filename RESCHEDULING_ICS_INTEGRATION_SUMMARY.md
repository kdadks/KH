# Booking Rescheduling ICS Calendar Integration - Summary Report

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
**Request**: When admin or user reschedules a booking and the rescheduling is confirmed, the rescheduling email should include an updated ICS calendar invite.

**Solution**: Enhanced the existing `booking_rescheduled` email system to include proper ICS calendar attachments with updated appointment details.

## ✅ Implementation Details

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **🔧 Enhanced ICS Attachment Logic**
   - Added `booking_rescheduled` to the list of email types that include calendar attachments
   - Extended the calendar attachment logic to support rescheduling scenarios
   - **File**: `/netlify/functions/send-email.cjs` (Line ~1564)

2. **📅 Enhanced ICS Generation Function**
   - Modified `generateICS()` to accept an `isRescheduled` parameter
   - Incremented sequence number (SEQUENCE:1) for rescheduled appointments
   - Enhanced calendar description with old appointment details and reschedule reason
   - Added "(Rescheduled)" indicator to appointment title
   - **File**: `/netlify/functions/send-email.cjs` (Line ~17)

3. **📁 Distinct File Naming**
   - Rescheduled appointments use filename: `rescheduled_appointment.ics`
   - Regular appointments use filename: `appointment.ics`

### **Email Types Supporting ICS Attachments:**

| Email Type | Purpose | ICS Filename | Sequence Number |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `admin_booking_confirmation` | Initial booking confirmations | `appointment.ics` | 0 |
| `booking_rescheduled` | Rescheduled appointments | `rescheduled_appointment.ics` | 1 |

## 📧 Enhanced ICS Content for Rescheduling

### **Standard Appointment ICS:**
```
SUMMARY:Physiotherapy Session - KH Therapy
DESCRIPTION:Physiotherapy Session appointment at KH Therapy\nBooking Reference: KH-123
SEQUENCE:0
```

### **Rescheduled Appointment ICS:**
```
SUMMARY:Physiotherapy Session - KH Therapy (Rescheduled)
DESCRIPTION:Physiotherapy Session appointment at KH Therapy\nBooking Reference: KH-123\nRescheduled from: 2024-03-15 at 10:30:00\nReschedule Reason: Customer requested different time slot\nSpecial Instructions: Please bring medical reports

```
