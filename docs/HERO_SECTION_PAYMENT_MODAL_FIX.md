# Hero Section Payment Workflow - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Booking Summary with Pay Now Button**
- **Issue**: Hero section was directly opening PaymentModal instead of showing booking summary
- **Cause**: Different workflow from main booking page
- **Fix**: Implemented same booking summary interface with "Pay Now" button

### 2. **Multiple Modal Problem**  
- **Issue**: After payment completion, another modal was appearing
- **Cause**: PaymentModal was calling both `onPaymentComplete` and `onClose` sequentially
- **Fix**: Smart onClose handler that only shows cancellation message when appropriate

### 3. **Incorrect Payment Cancellation Message**
- **Issue**: "Payment cancelled" message appeared even after successful payment
- **Cause**: PaymentModal calls both success and close handlers
- **Fix**: Conditional cancellation message based on payment state

### 4. **Form Visibility During Payment Flow**
- **Issue**: Booking form was always visible even during payment process
- **Cause**: No conditional rendering for payment states
- **Fix**: Hide form during payment flow, show booking summary instead

### 5. **Unnecessary Redirection**
- **Issue**: Hero section was trying to redirect to home page when already on home page
- **Cause**: Using same redirect logic as main booking page
- **Fix**: Removed redirection logic and just reset form after countdown

## Final Implementation

### Complete Payment State Management
```tsx
interface PaymentState {
  showPayment: boolean;
  paymentRequest: any;
  booking: any;
  customer: any;
  paymentCompleted: boolean;
}

const [paymentState, setPaymentState] = useState<PaymentState>({
  showPayment: false,
  paymentRequest: null,
  booking: null,
  customer: null,
  paymentCompleted: false
});
```

### Conditional Form Rendering
```tsx
{/* Main Booking Form - Only show if not in payment flow */}
{!paymentState.showPayment && !paymentState.paymentCompleted && (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">
    {/* Form fields */}
  </form>
)}
```

### Booking Summary with Pay Now Button
```tsx
{/* Payment Interface */}
{paymentState.showPayment && (
  <div className="mt-6 p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
    <div className="text-center">
      <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6">
        <p className="text-green-800 font-medium">✅ Booking Created Successfully!</p>
        <p className="text-green-600 text-sm mt-1">
          Service: {paymentState.booking?.package_name}
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6">
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Payment Required</h3>
        <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-3">
          A deposit payment of <strong>€{paymentState.paymentRequest?.amount}</strong> is required to confirm your booking.
        </p>
        <Button
          onClick={handlePayNow}
          variant="primary"
          className="w-full"
        >
          Pay Now - €{paymentState.paymentRequest?.amount}
        </Button>
      </div>

      <div className="text-center">
        <button
          onClick={resetForm}
          className="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 text-sm underline"
        >
          Cancel and start over
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### Smart PaymentModal Integration
```tsx
{/* PaymentModal */}
{showPaymentModal && selectedPaymentRequest && (
  <PaymentModal
    isOpen={showPaymentModal}
    onClose={() => {
      setShowPaymentModal(false);
      setSelectedPaymentRequest(null);
      // Only show cancellation message if payment wasn't completed
      if (!paymentState.paymentCompleted && !paymentProcessing) {
        setSuccessMsg('Payment cancelled. You can try again or contact us for assistance.');
      }
    }}
    paymentRequest={selectedPaymentRequest}
    onPaymentComplete={handlePaymentModalComplete}
  />
)}
```

### Protected Payment Completion
```tsx
const handlePaymentModalComplete = () => {
  // Prevent duplicate completion calls
  if (paymentProcessing || paymentState.paymentCompleted) return;
  
  setPaymentProcessing(true);
  
  // Close the payment modal
  setShowPaymentModal(false);
  setSelectedPaymentRequest(null);
  
  // Update payment state to completed
  setPaymentState(prev => ({ ...prev, paymentCompleted: true }));
  setSuccessMsg('Payment completed successfully! Your booking is confirmed.');
  setCountdown(20);
};
```

## Complete Workflow

### Hero Section Payment Flow (Now Matches Main Booking Page)
1. ✅ User fills out booking form
2. ✅ Form submits and creates booking
3. ✅ **Booking summary appears with Pay Now button**
4. ✅ User clicks "Pay Now" to open PaymentModal
5. ✅ User completes payment in modal
6. ✅ Modal closes cleanly (no duplicate modals)
7. ✅ Success message shows with countdown
8. ✅ Form resets after countdown completes
9. ✅ No incorrect cancellation messages
10. ✅ No page redirection (already on home)

### User Experience Improvements

- **Consistent Interface**: Now matches main booking page workflow exactly
- **Clear Payment Process**: Booking summary → Pay Now button → PaymentModal
- **Professional Flow**: Shows booking confirmation before requesting payment
- **No Confusion**: Form hides during payment process, only relevant interface shown
- **Appropriate Messaging**: Correct messages for each state (booking created, payment required, payment success)
- **Clean State Management**: Proper transitions between form → summary → payment → success
