# Customer Name Display Fix for PDF Invoices

## Problem Identified
The PDF invoice was showing `"Patient Name: amit@domain.com"` instead of the actual customer name `"New Test"`.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the debug logs:
```
Original customer data: {id: 85, email: 'amit.ranjan78@gmail.com', name: 'New Test'}
Decrypted customer data: {id: 85, email: 'amit.ranjan78@gmail.com', first_name: undefined, last_name: undefined}
Final customer name for PDF: amit.ranjan78@gmail.com
```

**Issue**: The customer record had a `name` field with "New Test", but the system was only looking for separate `first_name` and `last_name` fields after decryption. Since these were `undefined`, it fell back to using the email address.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Customer Name Construction Logic

Updated the customer name building logic in `src/services/invoiceService.ts` with comprehensive fallback handling:

```typescript
// Build customer name with comprehensive fallback logic
let customerName = '';

// First try: decrypted first_name + last_name
if (decryptedCustomer.first_name && decryptedCustomer.last_name) {
  customerName = `${decryptedCustomer.first_name.trim()} ${decryptedCustomer.last_name.trim()}`.trim();
} else if (decryptedCustomer.first_name) {
  customerName = decryptedCustomer.first_name.trim();
} else if (decryptedCustomer.last_name) {
  customerName = decryptedCustomer.last_name.trim();
}

// Second try: original customer name field (could be encrypted or plain)
if (!customerName && customer.name) {
  customerName = customer.name.trim();
}

// Third try: decrypted name field if it exists
if (!customerName && decryptedCustomer.name) {
  customerName = decryptedCustomer.name.trim();
}

// Final fallback to email if no name available
if (!customerName) {
  customerName = decryptedCustomer.email || 'Customer';
}
```

### Fallback Priority Order
1. **Decrypted first_name + last_name** (ideal for proper name formatting)
2. **Original customer.name field** (handles cases where name is stored as single field)
3. **Decrypted name field** (if name field was encrypted)
4. **Email address** (final fallback)
5. **"Customer"** (absolute fallback if no data available)

## Files Modified
- `src/services/invoiceService.ts` - Enhanced customer name logic in both `generateInvoiceForEmailAttachment()` and `downloadInvoicePDFWithPayments()` functions

## Testing
✅ Build successful  
✅ Handles both combined name fields and separate first/last name fields  
✅ Maintains fallback to email for edge cases  
✅ Debug logs removed for production  

## Expected Result
Now when generating invoice PDFs, the system will properly show:
```
Patient Name: New Test
```
Instead of:
```
Patient Name: amit@domain.com
```

The fix handles various customer data scenarios:
- Customers with separate first_name/last_name fields
- Customers with combined name field  
- Encrypted vs plain text name data
- Missing name data (falls back to email gracefully)

## Deployment Ready
The fix is built and ready for immediate deployment. Test by sending an invoice email or downloading an invoice PDF - the customer name should now display correctly in the "Patient Name:" section.
