## âœ… Completed
- [x] Created Netlify function for SMTP email sending
- [x] Migrated from EmailJS to server-side SMTP
- [x] Updated all email utilities to use new SMTP backend

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Set Netlify Environment Variables
In your Netlify dashboard (Site Settings > Environment Variables), add:

```
SMTP_USER=info@khtherapy.ie
SMTP_PASS=your_actual_email_password
```

**Important**: Replace `your_actual_email_password` with the real password for info@khtherapy.ie

### 2. Update Local Environment
In your local `.env` file, add:

```
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

For production, this will be automatically set to your Netlify domain.

### 3. Deploy to Netlify
```bash
git push origin main
```

This will trigger automatic deployment with the new email functionality.

### 4. Test Email Functionality
After deployment:
1. Go to your live site
2. Try booking an appointment
3. Check if confirmation emails are sent
4. Test payment request emails
5. Verify all email templates render correctly

### 5. Email Configuration Details

**SMTP Settings:**
- Host: smtp.hostinger.com
- Port: 465 (SSL/TLS)
- Security: SSL
- Authentication: Required
- From: info@khtherapy.ie

**Supported Email Types:**
- Booking confirmations
- Payment receipts
- Payment requests
- Booking reminders

### 6. Troubleshooting
If emails don't work:
1. Check Netlify environment variables are set
2. Verify SMTP credentials with Hostinger
3. Check Netlify function logs
4. Test SMTP settings with an email client first

### 7. Benefits of New Email System
- âœ… Professional email templates
- âœ… Better deliverability (direct SMTP)
- âœ… Server-side security (no exposed credentials)
- âœ… Better error handling

- âœ… Comprehensive logging

## ðŸ“§ Email Function Endpoint
Once deployed, emails will be sent via:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-email
```

The application will automatically use this endpoint for all email functionality.
