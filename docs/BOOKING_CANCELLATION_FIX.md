# Booking Cancellation Fix: Missing updated_at Column

## Issue Description

When admin tries to cancel a booking, the system throws this error:
```
Booking cancelled successfully, but email notification failed: Failed to update booking status: Could not find the 'updated_at' column of 'bookings' in the schema cache.
```

Additionally, the booking status remains as "confirmed" instead of being updated to "cancelled".

## Root Cause

The `integrateBookingCancellationWorkflow` function in `/src/utils/emailWorkflowIntegration.ts` was trying to update the `bookings` table with an `updated_at` field that doesn't exist in the database schema. The `bookings` table was missing this column while other tables like `payment_requests` and `payments` already had it.

## Files Changed

### 1. Database Migration Script
**File**: `/database/add-updated-at-to-bookings.sql`
- Adds `updated_at` column to the `bookings` table
- Creates a trigger to automatically update the timestamp on record changes
- Populates existing records with proper values

### 2. Code Updates
**File**: `/src/utils/emailWorkflowIntegration.ts`
- Removed explicit `updated_at` field from booking update queries (lines ~415 and ~615)
- The field will now be automatically managed by the database trigger
- Added comments explaining the automatic timestamp handling

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:
```bash
# Copy the contents of database/add-updated-at-to-bookings.sql
# and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Code Changes (Already Applied)
The code has been updated to:
- Remove explicit `updated_at` references from booking update queries
- Let the database trigger handle timestamp updates automatically
- Add proper comments for future maintainers

## Verification

After applying the fix:

1. **Check database column exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
     AND table_name = 'bookings' 
     AND column_name = 'updated_at';
   ```

2. **Test booking cancellation**:
   - Go to Admin → Bookings
   - Try to cancel a confirmed booking
   - Verify the booking status changes to "cancelled"
   - Verify no error messages appear

3. **Check trigger is working**:
   ```sql
   -- Update a booking and check if updated_at changes
   UPDATE bookings SET notes = 'Test update' WHERE id = 'some-booking-id';
   SELECT updated_at FROM bookings WHERE id = 'some-booking-id';
   ```

## Additional Benefits

With this fix:
- ✅ Booking cancellation now works correctly
- ✅ Booking status properly updates to "cancelled"
- ✅ Email notifications are sent successfully
- ✅ The `updated_at` field is automatically maintained for all future updates
- ✅ Better data tracking for when bookings were last modified
