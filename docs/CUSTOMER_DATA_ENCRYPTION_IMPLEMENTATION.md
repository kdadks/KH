# Customer Data Encryption Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of automatic encryption for customer sensitive data (first name, last name, and phone number) whenever a new customer is created from either the frontend or admin console.

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files

#### 1. `src/utils/customerBookingUtils.ts`
- **Function**: `findOrCreateCustomer()`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added import for GDPR encryption utilities
  - New customers: Encrypt `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` before database insertion
  - Existing customers: Decrypt stored data for comparison, encrypt new data for updates
  - Ensures both creation and update operations maintain encryption

#### 2. `src/components/admin/CustomerManagement.tsx`
- **Function**: `handleSubmit()`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `encryptSensitiveData` from GDPR utilities
  - Create customer: Encrypt sensitive fields before database insertion
  - Update customer: Encrypt sensitive fields before database update
  - Maintains admin console functionality while ensuring data protection

### Encryption Implementation

#### Sensitive Fields Encrypted
- `first_name` - Customer's first name
- `last_name` - Customer's last name  
- `phone` - Customer's phone number

#### Encryption Method
- **Algorithm**: AES encryption using CryptoJS library
- **Key**: Environment variable `VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (with fallback)
- **Utilities**: Uses existing GDPR compliance utilities (`gdprUtils.ts`)

#### Data Flow

**Frontend Booking Forms (Hero Section & Booking Page)**:
1. User submits booking form with customer data
2. `findOrCreateCustomer()` called with plain text data
3. For new customers: Encrypt sensitive fields before database insertion
4. For existing customers: Decrypt stored data for comparison, encrypt updates
5. Database stores encrypted values

**Admin Console Customer Management**:
1. Admin creates/updates customer through admin interface
2. `handleSubmit()` encrypts sensitive fields before database operation
3. Database stores encrypted values
4. Admin interface decrypts data for display using existing GDPR utilities

### Security Benefits

1. **Data at Rest Protection**: Customer PII encrypted in database
2. **GDPR Compliance**: Aligns with data protection requirements
3. **Consistent Implementation**: Uses existing encryption infrastructure
4. **Transparent Operation**: No changes to user experience
5. **Admin Access**: Admin users can still view decrypted data through existing GDPR utilities

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation includes checks for already encrypted data:
- `isDataEncrypted()` function prevents double encryption
- Supports gradual migration of existing unencrypted data
- Maintains functionality with mixed encrypted/unencrypted data

### Integration Points

The encryption is automatically applied at these customer creation points:
1. **Hero Section Booking** (`HeroSection.tsx`)
2. **Main Booking Page** (`BookingPage.tsx`) 
3. **Admin Console Customer Creation** (`CustomerManagement.tsx`)
4. **Admin Console Booking Creation** (via `createBookingWithCustomer`)

All paths use the centralized `findOrCreateCustomer()` utility ensuring consistent encryption.

### Testing Verification

To verify encryption is working:
1. Create a new customer through any booking form
2. Check database directly - sensitive fields should show encrypted values
3. View customer in admin console - data should display decrypted
4. No user-facing functionality should change

### Environment Setup

Ensure the following environment variable is set:
```
VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key-here
```

**Note**: In production, use a strong, unique encryption key and manage it securely.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Frontend customer creation (booking forms)
- Admin console customer creation/updates
- Integration with existing GDPR utilities
- Backward compatibility with existing data
- No breaking changes to user experience

✅ **Verified**:
- No compilation errors
- Hot reload working correctly
- Existing functionality preserved
- Encryption applied at all customer creation points

This implementation ensures all customer sensitive data is automatically encrypted before storage while maintaining full application functionality and user experience.
