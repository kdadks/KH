# Welcome Email Duplicate Prevention Fix

## Issue
Welcome emails were being sent to customers on every booking creation, even for existing customers who had already received welcome emails previously.

## Root Cause
The `createBookingWithCustomer()` function in `customerBookingUtils.ts` was sending welcome emails to all customers regardless of whether they were new or existing customers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Customer Type Detection**
- Modified `findOrCreateCustomer()` function to return `isNewCustomer` flag
- This flag indicates whether a customer was just created or already existed

### 2. **Database Tracking**
- Added `welcome_email_sent` boolean column to `customers` table
- Prevents duplicate welcome emails even in race conditions
- Existing customers are marked as having received welcome emails

### 3. **Smart Welcome Email Logic**
The welcome email is now sent only when:
- ✅ Customer is newly created (`isNewCustomer = true`)
- ✅ Welcome email hasn't been sent yet (`welcome_email_sent = false`)

### 4. **Database Update After Send**
When welcome email is successfully sent:
- Customer record is updated with `welcome_email_sent = true`
- Future bookings from same customer will skip welcome email

## Files Modified

### **Database Schema**
- `database/add-welcome-email-tracking.sql`: Adds tracking column

### **TypeScript Files**
- `src/utils/customerBookingUtils.ts`:
  - Updated `Customer` interface with `welcome_email_sent` field
  - Modified `findOrCreateCustomer()` to return `isNewCustomer` flag
  - Updated welcome email logic to check both flags
  - Added database update after successful email send

## Usage Examples

### **New Customer Flow:**
1. Customer books for first time → `isNewCustomer = true`, `welcome_email_sent = false`
2. Welcome email sent → Database updated with `welcome_email_sent = true`
3. Customer books again → `isNewCustomer = false`, welcome email skipped

### **Existing Customer Flow:**
1. Existing customer books → `isNewCustomer = false`
2. Welcome email skipped entirely
3. Only booking confirmation/payment emails sent

## Benefits

### ✅ **Prevents Spam**
- Customers receive welcome email only once
- No more duplicate welcome emails on subsequent bookings

### ✅ **Database Safety**
- Tracking in database prevents race conditions
- Existing customers protected from retroactive welcome emails

### ✅ **Proper Customer Experience**
- New customers get proper welcome with account setup instructions
- Existing customers get straight to booking confirmations

### ✅ **Logging & Debugging**
- Clear console logs distinguish between new/existing customers
- Easy to track welcome email sending status

## Database Migration Required

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Add welcome email tracking
ALTER TABLE customers 
ADD COLUMN welcome_email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Mark existing customers as having received welcome email
UPDATE customers 
SET welcome_email_sent = TRUE 
WHERE created_at < NOW();
```

## Testing Verification

### **Test Case 1: New Customer**
1. Create booking with new email address
2. Verify welcome email is sent
3. Check database: `welcome_email_sent = true`

### **Test Case 2: Existing Customer**
1. Create another booking with same email
2. Verify no welcome email sent
3. Verify booking confirmation sent normally

### **Test Case 3: Multiple Rapid Bookings**
1. Create multiple bookings quickly with same new email
2. Verify only one welcome email sent
3. Database flag prevents duplicates
