# Payment Request Email System with Real SumUp API Integration

## üéâ **System Enhancement Complete!**

The payment request email system has been updated to use **real SumUp API checkout URLs** and includes **automatic payment confirmation emails**.

## What's Been Updated

### ‚úÖ **Payment Request Emails Now Include Real SumUp URLs**

**File**: `src/utils/paymentRequestUtils.ts` - `sendPaymentRequestNotification()`

**Before**: 
- Emails contained generic payment page links: `/payment?request=123`
- Customers had to go through payment modal interface

**After**:
- Emails contain **direct SumUp checkout URLs**: `/sumup-checkout?checkout_reference=xxx&amount=23&...&payment_request_id=123`
- Customers can pay immediately using real SumUp payment processing
- Automatic fallback to payment page if SumUp API fails

### ‚úÖ **Payment Confirmation Emails Automatically Sent**

**Files**: 
- `src/utils/paymentRequestUtils.ts` - `processPaymentRequest()`
- `src/pages/SumUpCheckoutPage.tsx` - `processPayment()`
- `src/components/shared/PaymentModal.tsx` - `handlePaymentComplete()`

**Enhancement**:
- When any payment is completed, `sendPaymentConfirmation()` is automatically called
- Customers receive professional payment receipt emails
- Admin gets notification that payment was received

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Checkout Page for Payment Requests**

**File**: `src/pages/SumUpCheckoutPage.tsx`

**New Features**:
- Extracts `payment_request_id` from URL parameters
- Processes payment requests automatically when payment completes
- Links payments to original booking requests
- Triggers confirmation email sending

## Technical Implementation

### Real SumUp API Integration in Emails
```typescript
// In sendPaymentRequestNotification()
try {
  const checkoutResponse = await createSumUpCheckoutSession({
    checkout_reference: `payment-request-${paymentRequestId}-${Date.now()}`,
    amount: paymentRequest.amount,
    currency: 'EUR',
    merchant_code: 'MQEKWZR0',
    description: paymentRequest.service_name
  });
  
  // Direct SumUp checkout URL
  directPaymentUrl = `/sumup-checkout?checkout_reference=${checkoutResponse.checkout_reference}&amount=${paymentRequest.amount}&payment_request_id=${paymentRequestId}`;
  
} catch (realApiError) {
  // Fallback to payment page
  directPaymentUrl = `/payment?request=${paymentRequestId}`;
}
```

### Automatic Payment Processing
```typescript
// In SumUpCheckoutPage processPayment()
if (paymentRequestId) {
  const paymentResult = await processPaymentRequest(
    parseInt(paymentRequestId),
    {
      payment_request_id: parseInt(paymentRequestId),
      sumup_checkout_id: checkoutId,
      sumup_transaction_id: transactionId,
      payment_method: 'sumup',
      sumup_payment_type: 'card'
    }
  );
  // processPaymentRequest automatically calls sendPaymentConfirmation()
}
```

### URL Generation Safety
```typescript
// Handle both browser and server contexts
try {
  baseUrl = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : 'https://khtherapy.ie';
} catch (error) {
  baseUrl = 'https://khtherapy.ie'; // Production fallback
}
```
