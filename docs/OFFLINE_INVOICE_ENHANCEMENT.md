# Enhanced Invoice Generation Feature - Online vs Offline Invoices

## Overview
The invoice generation feature has been enhanced to support two types of invoices:

1. **Online Invoice** - Existing functionality with online payment flow
2. **Offline Invoice** - New functionality for offline payments with immediate payment confirmation

## Features

### Online Invoice (Existing Functionality)
- Deposit amount is automatically deducted from the total
- Customer pays the remaining balance online
- Invoice status starts as "draft" and moves to "paid" after payment
- Payment requests can be sent to customers

### Offline Invoice (New Feature)
- Full payment amount is marked as received offline
- No deposit deduction applied
- Invoice status is immediately set to "paid"
- Zero balance due - final invoice with full payment confirmation
- Perfect for cash payments or offline transactions

## User Interface

### Invoice Type Selection Tabs
- Appears after customer and booking are selected
- Two tabs: "Online Invoice" and "Offline Invoice"
- Clear descriptions of each invoice type
- Visual indicators showing deposit deductions or offline payment status

### Smart UI Behavior
- Tabs only appear when customer and booking are selected
- Cannot change invoice type for existing paid invoices
- Different colors: Blue for online, Green for offline
- Contextual help text explains each option

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Uses existing invoice schema
- Offline invoices have `status: 'paid'`
- Special notes field indicates offline payment
- Full amount stored without deposit deduction for offline invoices

### Invoice Summary Logic
```typescript
// Online Invoice
finalAmount = subtotal - deposits
status = 'draft'
notes = 'Deposit Deducted: €XX.XX'

// Offline Invoice  
finalAmount = subtotal (full amount)
status = 'paid'
notes = 'Offline Payment Received: €XX.XX - Full payment received offline'
```

### Form Validation
- Prevents invoice type changes on paid invoices
- Maintains data integrity
- Clear user feedback

## Business Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Standard Online Flow
1. Customer books service online
2. Pays 20% deposit automatically
3. Admin creates online invoice
4. Remaining 80% is due online
5. Customer pays through payment link

### Scenario 2: Offline Payment Flow
1. Customer books service online
2. Pays 20% deposit automatically  
3. Customer pays remaining 80% offline (cash/bank transfer)
4. Admin creates offline invoice
5. Full amount marked as paid, zero balance due

### Scenario 3: Full Offline Payment
1. Customer pays full amount offline before/during service
2. Admin creates offline invoice
3. Invoice shows full payment received
4. Customer gets final paid invoice
