# Payment System Refactoring - Database-Driven Pricing

## Overview
Successfully refactored the payment system from hardcoded service costs to a database-driven, configurable pricing system.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Configuration Management
- **Created**: `src/config/paymentConfig.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Configurable deposit percentage (currently 20%)
  - Configurable currency settings (EUR with € symbol)
  - Payment status enums
  - Centralized payment configuration

### 2. Database-Driven Pricing Service
- **Created**: `src/services/pricingService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches service pricing directly from the `services` database table
  - Extracts base service names from full service descriptions
  - Determines time slot type (in-hour vs out-of-hour)
  - Handles numeric price extraction from various formats
  - Proper fallback mechanisms

### 3. Updated Payment Request Utils
- **Modified**: `src/utils/paymentRequestUtils.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses database pricing as primary source
  - Falls back to regex extraction for backward compatibility
  - Uses configurable deposit percentage from config file
  - Removed hardcoded SERVICE_COSTS mapping
  - Dynamic currency handling

### 4. Updated Admin Bookings Component
- **Modified**: `src/components/admin/Bookings.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed dependency on hardcoded SERVICE_COSTS
  - Implemented async deposit amount calculation
  - Added state management for precomputed deposit amounts
  - Uses database pricing service for accurate cost calculations

### 5. Clean Type Definitions
- **Modified**: `src/types/paymentTypes.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded SERVICE_COSTS mapping (150+ lines removed)
  - Removed DEFAULT_SERVICE_PRICING constant
  - Kept ServicePricing interface for type safety
  - Cleaner, more maintainable type definitions

## Technical Benefits

### 1. **Maintainability**
- No more hardcoded prices scattered throughout the codebase
- Single source of truth in the database
- Easy to update pricing through database changes

### 2. **Scalability**
- New services automatically supported when added to database
- No code changes required for pricing updates
- Supports unlimited service variations

### 3. **Configurability**
- Deposit percentage can be changed via config file
- Currency settings centralized
- Easy to switch deposit percentage from 20% to any value

### 4. **Reliability**
- Multiple fallback mechanisms prevent failures
- Database-first approach with graceful degradation
- Proper error handling throughout

## Database Integration

The system now properly integrates with the existing `services` table:
```sql
services (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  in_hour_price VARCHAR(50),    -- e.g., "€65"
  out_of_hour_price VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "€75"
  is_active BOOLEAN
)
```

## Pricing Flow

1. **Service Name Parsing**: "Ultimate Health - Out of Hour (€280)" 
   → Base: "Ultimate Health", Type: "out_of_hour"

2. **Database Lookup**: Fetch pricing from services table for "Ultimate Health"

3. **Price Selection**: Use `out_of_hour_price` field based on detected type

4. **Deposit Calculation**: Apply configurable percentage (20% default)

5. **Fallback**: If database fails, extract price from service name regex

## Configuration

To change deposit percentage, update `src/config/paymentConfig.ts`:
```typescript
export const PAYMENT_CONFIG = {
  DEPOSIT_PERCENTAGE: 0.25, // Change to 25%
  // ...
}
```

## Test Results

✅ **Ultimate Health - Out of Hour**: €280 → €56 deposit (20%)
✅ **Basic Wellness - In Hour**: €65 → €13 deposit (20%)  
✅ **Sports Massage - Out of Hour**: €85 → €17 deposit (20%)

## Future Considerations

1. **Price History**: Could add price versioning to track changes
2. **Dynamic Deposits**: Could make deposit percentage per-service configurable
3. **Currency Conversion**: Could add multi-currency support
4. **Price Validation**: Could add database constraints for price formats

## Migration Notes

- ✅ Build successful with no breaking changes
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained through fallback pricing
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Payment system successfully refactored to use database-driven pricing with configurable settings.
