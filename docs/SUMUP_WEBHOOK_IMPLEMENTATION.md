## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: Uses HMAC SHA-256 with webhook secret
- **Environment Variables**: `SUMUP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for production security
- **Development Mode**: Graceful handling when secret not configured
- **CORS Support**: Proper headers for cross-origin requests

### Event Processing
The webhook processes these SumUp events:
- `checkout.completed` → Status: `paid`
- `checkout.failed` → Status: `failed`
- `checkout.pending` → Status: `processing`
- `transaction.successful` → Status: `paid`
- `transaction.failed` → Status: `failed`

### Database Updates
- **Existing Records**: Updates payment status and webhook metadata
- **New Records**: Creates payments when sufficient data available
- **Payment Requests**: Updates status to `paid` for successful payments
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks webhook processing with timestamps and event IDs

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Signatures**: Returns 401 Unauthorized
- **Malformed JSON**: Returns 400 Bad Request
- **Missing Records**: Attempts to create or logs warning
- **Database Errors**: Returns 500 with error details
- **Duplicate Events**: Safely handles repeat webhook calls

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Add to your Netlify environment variables:
```bash
SUMUP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_sumup_webhook_secret_key
```

### 2. Deploy Webhook
The webhook endpoint will be available at:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/sumup-webhook
```

### 3. Configure SumUp
1. Log in to SumUp merchant dashboard
2. Navigate to Developer → Webhooks
3. Add webhook URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/sumup-webhook`
4. Enable events: `checkout.completed`, `checkout.failed`, `checkout.pending`, `transaction.successful`, `transaction.failed`
5. Copy webhook secret to Netlify environment variables

### 4. Test Implementation
```bash
# Test with the provided script
cd scripts
node test-sumup-webhook.js

# Or test manually with curl
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/sumup-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"test","type":"checkout.completed","data":{"id":"test-checkout","status":"PAID","amount":2500,"currency":"EUR"}}'
```

## 📊 Validation Queries

Run these queries in Supabase to validate webhook processing:

```sql
-- Check recent webhook events
SELECT 
  id, amount, status, sumup_event_type, webhook_processed_at
FROM payments 
WHERE webhook_processed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY webhook_processed_at DESC;

-- Verify payment request status updates
SELECT pr.id, pr.status as request_status, p.status as payment_status
FROM payment_requests pr
LEFT JOIN payments p ON p.booking_id = pr.booking_id
WHERE p.webhook_processed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Netlify Function Logs
- Go to Netlify Dashboard → Functions → `sumup-webhook`
- View Function log for webhook processing details
- Look for success/error messages and database updates

### SumUp Dashboard
- Check webhook delivery status in SumUp merchant dashboard
- Verify events are being sent successfully
- Review any delivery failures or retries

### Database Monitoring
- Monitor `webhook_processed_at` field for new webhook events
- Check `sumup_event_type` and `sumup_event_id` for event tracking
- Validate payment status updates match SumUp transaction statuses

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

1. **Real-time Updates**: Payment statuses update automatically when customers complete payments
2. **Reduced Manual Work**: No need to manually check payment statuses in SumUp dashboard
3. **Better Customer Experience**: Immediate payment confirmation and status updates
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete webhook processing history for troubleshooting
5. **Security**: Cryptographically verified webhooks prevent unauthorized updates
6. **Reliability**: Error handling ensures webhook failures don't break the system

## 🔮 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Notifications**: Send customer emails for successful payments
2. **Admin Alerts**: Notify administrators of failed payments
3. **Retry Logic**: Handle webhook delivery failures with exponential backoff
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Display real-time payment status in admin dashboard
5. **Analytics**: Track payment success rates and processing times

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Netlify function logs for error details
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure SumUp webhook configuration matches your endpoint URL
4. Run the validation SQL scripts to check database state
5. Use the test script to verify webhook functionality

The webhook implementation is production-ready and will automatically handle all SumUp payment events moving forward! 🚀
