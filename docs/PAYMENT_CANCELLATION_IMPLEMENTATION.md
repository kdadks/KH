# Payment Cancellation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive payment cancellation functionality to ensure payment request statuses are properly updated when users click "Cancel and start over" buttons.

## Problem
When users click "Cancel and start over" after a payment modal opens, the payment request status remained "sent" instead of being changed to "cancelled" in the database.

## Solution
Created a centralized payment cancellation system with proper error handling and status updates.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/utils/paymentCancellation.ts`
**Purpose**: Centralized utility for handling payment request cancellations

**Key Functions**:
- `cancelPaymentRequest(paymentRequestId, reason?)`: Cancels a payment request and updates status to 'cancelled'
- `canCancelPaymentRequest(paymentRequest)`: Validates if a payment request can be cancelled 
- `handlePaymentModalCancellation(paymentRequestId)`: Convenience wrapper for modal cancellations

**Features**:
- Proper error handling with detailed logging
- Status validation (only cancels 'pending' or 'sent' requests)
- Optional cancellation reason tracking
- Comprehensive error messages

## Files Modified

### 2. `src/components/shared/PaymentModal.tsx`
**Changes**: 
- Added `handleModalClose` function to properly handle payment cancellations
- Updated "Cancel and start over" button to call cancellation logic
- Integrated with payment cancellation utility

### 3. `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added import for `cancelPaymentRequest`
- Updated `resetForm` function to be async and cancel active payment requests
- Added proper error handling for cancellation failures

### 4. `src/pages/BookingPage.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added import for `cancelPaymentRequest`
- Updated `resetForm` function to be async and cancel active payment requests
- Updated `redirectToHome` function to be async and await resetForm
- Updated `handleEscape` function to properly handle async calls

### 5. `src/components/BookingForm.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added import for `cancelPaymentRequest`
- Updated `resetForm` function to be async and cancel active payment requests
- Updated call to `resetForm()` in handleSubmit to await the async function

## Implementation Details

### Cancellation Flow
1. User clicks "Cancel and start over" button
2. System checks if there's an active payment request
3. If payment request exists and is cancellable, status is updated to 'cancelled'
4. Form state is reset to initial values
5. Any errors are logged but don't block the form reset

### Error Handling
- All cancellation attempts are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Errors are logged to console with descriptive messages
- Form reset continues even if cancellation fails
- Non-blocking error handling ensures user experience isn't disrupted

### Status Validation
- Only payment requests with 'pending' or 'sent' status can be cancelled
- 'paid', 'cancelled', or 'expired' requests are not modified
- Proper validation prevents data inconsistencies

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Cancellation**: Click "Cancel and start over" after payment modal opens
   - ✅ Payment request status should change to 'cancelled'
   - ✅ Form should reset to initial state

2. **Multiple Cancellations**: Cancel and create new payment requests multiple times
   - ✅ Each cancellation should work independently
   - ✅ No interference between different payment requests

3. **Error Scenarios**: Network issues during cancellation
   - ✅ Form still resets even if cancellation API fails
   - ✅ Error is logged for debugging

4. **Edge Cases**: Cancelling already cancelled/paid requests
   - ✅ System validates status before attempting cancellation
   - ✅ No database errors from invalid state transitions

## Database Impact

### `payment_requests` Table
- Status column updated from 'sent' → 'cancelled' when users cancel
- Optional reason tracking in cancellation_reason column (if exists)
- Proper RLS policies ensure only authorized cancellations

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Payment request statuses accurately reflect user actions
2. **User Experience**: Clear cancellation flow with proper feedback
3. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Consistency**: Same cancellation logic used across all booking forms
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of API failures

## Future Enhancements

1. Add cancellation reason dropdown in UI
2. Implement cancellation email notifications
3. Add analytics tracking for cancellation rates
4. Consider partial refund handling for paid requests
